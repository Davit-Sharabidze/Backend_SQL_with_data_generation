This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a simple billing system backend using:

PostgreSQL (relational database)

Python (database interaction & data simulation)

psycopg2 (PostgreSQL driver)

The system incorporates Python scripts to produce realistic simulation data and perform analytical queries. It models customers, products, orders, and order items.
